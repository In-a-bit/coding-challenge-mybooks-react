# My Books Web Application - Coding Challenge

Hello! We are really exitced getting to know you, and would like also to know how it is to be working with you. 

We would like to ask you to complete this reletively small project to help us understand how you approach, design and express your solutions.

Please see this is less then a rigid test, and more of an opportunity to express yourself and show your love for coding.

## Specs

Please create a books favorites organizer system.

* The system should consist only of **frontend web application**. 
  * If data is needed to be saved, the browser facilities should be used instead of a backend app.
* **Login screen** that does a fake login
  * No authentication needed. The user is transfered to the next page after login
* Books list screen
  * **Book list** - The list is fetched from any free **books api** on the web. Select one the fits you best. Links to some free resources are given below.
  * **Book item** - Each book will be presented in a box detaling some of the book main **details**.
  * **Pagination** controls that will allow to fetch **next/previous** page of books
  * **Show-More** - Each book will have a show-more button that will **transfer or open another** window showing the book **details in depth**.
  * **Favorite** - Each book will have a **favorite-toggle botton** that will **save** the book to the user favorites. If the book is already in the faviroties list, then it need to be **shown as such**.

## What to do

* Please use React and any other libraries you see fit needed for that tasks. (State managemnets, routing..)
* Please try to host the app somewhere (Ex github pages, netlify..) where it will be easily be seen and played from the start.
* Where needed, please document your application

## Documentation
Please write a README that details the application and reasons behind main choices done regarding the code.
 
## How we review

Mainly, those aspects of coding will be assessed:

* Correctness - The application does what was asked
* Code quality - Clean code for resuablity and maintainability
* Architecture - Is the structure of the code reasonable for the given tasks
